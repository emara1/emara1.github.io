		<p>Art, to me, is a very personal thing. Something that I have always respected, admired and
loved. Something that I always thought of as something that others, with talent, were able
to produce.
I have always loved doodling, drawing in the margins of my school work, making random
patterns all over the notes of my faculty meeting agendas, but true art, I didn’t feel I was
capable of producing that. I started out slow, making thank you cards and birthday cards
for friends. Many recognized that these were similar to my drawings that I did all of the
time to keep my focus on what was happening around me, in meetings or while on the
phone. I couldn’t just sit and listen. As a school counselor, I recognized this as a valuable
focusing mechanism and actually advised students to give it a try.
But true “art?” No, my work wasn’t that. It involved a cheap pen and white space on
copier paper. I always said that I would be an artist when pigs fly. Well, at my first craft
fair, a stranger asked me if I was the artist that created the cards, and I almost cried. Pigs
must be flying.
So, If I am an “artist,” and pigs are flying somewhere, perhaps there is more of the
impossible that can be possible. I know it’s just a small part, but at least 5% of all of the
proceeds from sales of my cards, wall art and office supplies will go to the Dana Farber
Cancer Institute, in hopes that pigs are flying elsewhere and the impossible becomes
possible.</p>
