		<p>Art, to me, is a very personal thing. Something that I have always respected, admired and loved. Something that I always thought of as something that others, with training and talent, were able to produce. I have always loved doodling, drawing in the margins of my school work, making random patterns all over the notes of my faculty meeting agendas, but true art, felt out of reach to me. I started out slow, making thank you cards and birthday cards for friends. Many recognized that these were similar to my drawings that I did all of the time to keep my focus on what was happening around me, in meetings or while on the phone. I couldn’t just sit and listen. As a school counselor, I recognized this as a valuable focusing mechanism and actually advised students to give it a try. But I still had a hard time seeing it as “art”. It involved a cheap pen and white space on copier paper. I always said that I would be an artist when pigs fly. Well, at my first craft fair, a stranger asked me if I was the artist that created the cards, and I almost cried. Pigs must be flying. So, If I am an “artist,” and pigs are flying somewhere, perhaps there is more of the impossible that can be possible. At least 5% of all of the proceeds from sales of my cards, wall art and office supplies will go to the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, in hopes that pigs are flying elsewhere and the impossible becomes possible.</p>
